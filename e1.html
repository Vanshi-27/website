         <h2><i>About Mining</h2></i>
    <p>Mining refers to the extraction of valuable minerals, metals, and other geological materials from the Earth's crust. It is an essential industry that provides the raw materials necessary for various industrial processes, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. Mining operations can involve extracting minerals such as coal, iron, copper, gold, diamonds, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>There are several methods of mining, including:<br>

      <div id="Demo1" class="w3-container w3-hide">
       <p> This method involves removing the topsoil and overburden to access the mineral deposits beneath the surface. Surface mining is used for shallow deposits and includes techniques such as open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining.In most forms of surface mining, heavy equipment, such as earthmovers, first remove the overburden. Next, large machines, such as dragline excavators or bucket-wheel excavators, extract the mineral.</p><br>
<p>Advantages of surface mining include lower cost and greater safety compared to underground mining. Disadvantages include hazards to human health and the environment. Humans face a variety of health risks caused by mining such as different cardiovascular diseases, food, and water contamination. Habitat destruction, alongside air, noise, and water pollution, are all significant negative environmental impacts caused by the side effects of surface mining.<br><br></p>

    <button onclick="myFunction('Demo2')" class="w3-btn w3-block w3-black w3-left-align">Underground mining</button>
    <div id="Demo2" class="w3-container w3-hide">
     <p>In this method, tunnels or shafts are dug deep into the Earth to access the mineral deposits. Underground mining is used for deeper deposits that are not accessible through surface mining. Techniques such as drift mining, slope mining, and shaft mining are employed depending on the specific geological conditions.</p>
     <p>There are various methods of underground mining, including:<br>
     <b>1. Room and pillar mining:</b> This method involves creating rooms or chambers underground and leaving pillars of the ore or rock to support the roof. The ore is then extracted from the rooms.<br>   
     <b>2.Longwall mining:</b>In this method, a long wall of coal or ore is mined in a single slice. As the machinery moves along the wall, the ore is extracted, and the roof is allowed to collapse behind the mining equipment.<br>
     <b>3.Shaft mining:</b> Vertical tunnels, called shafts, are dug deep into the ground to access the ore deposits. Elevators or hoists are used to transport miners and equipment up and down the shafts.</p>
     <p>Underground mining can be more challenging and dangerous than surface mining due to limited space, ventilation concerns, and the risk of cave-ins or collapses. However, it is often necessary for extracting valuable resources that are located deep beneath the Earth's surface. Environmental impacts are also a concern with underground mining, particularly in terms of water management and potential subsidence issues.</p>

        <div id="Demo3" class="w3-container w3-hide">
         <p>Placer mining, ancient method of using water to excavate, transport, concentrate, and recover heavy minerals from alluvial or placer deposits. Examples of deposits mined by means of this technique are the gold-bearing sands and gravel that settle out from rapidly moving streams and rivers at points where the current slows down. Placer mining takes advantage of goldâ€™s high density, which causes it to sink more rapidly from moving water than the lighter siliceous materials with which it is found. Though the basic principles of placer mining have not altered since early times, methods have improved considerably.</p>
         <p>It was used by miners during the great gold strikes of the 19th century, employed a pan in which a few handfuls of the gold-bearing soil or gravel and a large amount of water were placed. By swirling the contents of the pan, the miner washed the lighter material over the side, leaving the gold and heavy materials behind.</p>
         <p>There are many other different types of mining.</p>

    <h2><i>Environmental Effects</h2></i>
    <p><ul>Mining can have significant and varied effects on the environment, depending on factors such as the type of mining, the scale of operations, and the specific geological and environmental conditions of the area. Some of the key environmental effects of mining include:</p>

<li> <b>Deforestation:</b> In regions where mining occurs, forests may be cleared to make way for infrastructure such as roads, mines, and processing facilities. Deforestation can have far-reaching consequences, including soil erosion, loss of carbon sequestration capacity, and disruption of local hydrological cycles.</li><br>
<center><img src="download.jpg"height="300" width="300"class="place"></center>
<li><b>Water Pollution:</b> Mining operations can contaminate nearby water bodies with various pollutants, including heavy metals, acids, and sediments. These pollutants can enter rivers, streams, and groundwater, posing risks to aquatic life and human health. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a particularly severe form of water pollution caused by the oxidation of sulfide minerals in mine waste.</li><br>
<center><img src="OIP.jpg"height="300" width="300"class="place"></center>
<li><b>Soil Degradation:</b> Mining activities can lead to soil erosion, compaction, and contamination, reducing soil fertility and productivity. Contaminants from mining operations can persist in the soil for long periods, posing risks to plant growth and agricultural activities.</li><br>
<center><img src="download(1).jpg"height="300" width="300"class="place"></center>
<li><b> Air Pollution:</b> Dust and particulate matter generated during mining operations can contribute to air pollution, affecting air quality and human health. Additionally, mining activities may release harmful gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere.</li><br>
